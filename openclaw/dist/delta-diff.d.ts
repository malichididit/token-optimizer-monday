 * Minimal line-diff for Delta Mode (Token Optimizer v5).

 * standard LCS table walk to emit a "compact" diff:
 *   - Lines that appear in both files are omitted.
 *   - Deletions prefixed with "- "
 *   - Insertions prefixed with "+ "
 *   - A short header with the total +N/-N counts.
 *
 * Designed for small payloads (<50KB of cached content). On larger inputs
 * it falls back to a "file changed, full re-read" marker so the LCS table
 * does not blow up on pathological cases.
