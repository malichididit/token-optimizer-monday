 * Token Optimizer - Read Cache for OpenClaw.
 *
 * Intercepts Read tool calls via agent:tool:before events to detect redundant reads.
 * Default ON (warn mode). Opt out via TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_READ_CACHE=0 env var
 * or config.json {"read_cache_enabled": false}.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   warn  (default) - logs redundant read, does NOT block
 *   block           - returns digest instead of re-reading
 *
 * Security:
 *   - Path canonicalization via path.resolve()
 *   - 0o600 permissions on cache files
 *   - mtime re-verification on every cache hit
 *   - Binary file skip
 *   - .contextignore support (hard block)
