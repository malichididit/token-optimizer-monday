# Token Optimizer for VS Code

See your Claude Code **context health, efficiency, and usage limits** right in the
VS Code status bar — no integrated terminal required.

Most people who live in the Claude Code extension panel never see the terminal status
line, so they fly blind on context pressure and usage limits. This companion brings the
full Token Optimizer status line into VS Code's own UI.

## What it shows

Two status-bar items, plus a rich hover tooltip:

- **Context fill %** with a bar
- **ContextQ** — resource health grade + score
- **Eff** — session efficiency grade + score
- **Warnings** — fill / tool-fatigue / regime-change
- **Compactions** + estimated context loss
- **Session duration** and **active subagents**
- **5-hour and 7-day usage limits** with reset times

Click either item to open the Token Optimizer dashboard.

## How it gets the data

It reads the files Token Optimizer already writes to `~/.claude/token-optimizer/`
(quality scores from the `UserPromptSubmit` hook, context fill and rate limits from the
status line) and tails the session transcript as a fallback. Pure file-watching, zero
network — with one optional exception below.

When you click to open the dashboard, the extension first probes a local Token Optimizer
daemon at `http://localhost:24842` and falls back to opening the generated HTML file. That
localhost probe is the only non-OAuth network activity, and it fires only on an explicit click.

## Usage Limits

Usage limits are exact when fresh Claude statusline data is available. If not, Token
Optimizer falls back to a clearly labeled local estimate or the last captured value:

- **verified** — captured from Claude Code's statusline cache
- **estimated** — computed locally from recent transcript usage
- **cached** — last captured value, with update age shown

Use **Token Optimizer: Refresh Now** or the panel's **Refresh** button to re-read the
cache and recompute the local transcript estimate. No terminal workflow required.

## Install

**From VSIX (GitHub release):**

```
code --install-extension token-optimizer-statusline-<version>.vsix
```

or in VS Code: Extensions → `...` → **Install from VSIX**.

Works in VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.

## Requires

[Token Optimizer](https://github.com/malichididit/token-optimizer-monday) installed in Claude Code
(it writes the data this extension reads).
