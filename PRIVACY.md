# Privacy Policy

**Token Optimizer** is a source-available developer tool that runs entirely on your local machine. It optimizes AI coding assistant context windows across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Hermes.

## No External Data Transmission

- **No telemetry**: No usage data, analytics, or metrics are sent anywhere.
- **No network calls**: Zero outbound network requests. The only network activity is a loopback-only (127.0.0.1) dashboard server for local visualization.
- **No third-party services**: No external APIs, tracking pixels, or data processors.
- **No accounts required**: No sign-up, login, or registration.

## What Token Optimizer Reads

To perform its analysis, Token Optimizer reads files that already exist on your machine:

- Host platform session transcripts (JSONL files under `~/.claude/projects/`)
- `~/.claude/settings.json` and project-level `.claude/settings.json`
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project-level `CLAUDE.md`, and `~/.claude/MEMORY.md`
- Skill and command directories under `~/.claude/`
- MCP server configurations

These files are read locally and never transmitted.

## What Token Optimizer Stores

Token Optimizer writes several local data stores. All are stored with restrictive file permissions (`0o700` directories, `0o600` files).

### Session Metrics Database (trends.db)

SQLite database containing per-session aggregates: token counts, model usage, cost estimates, session UUIDs, JSONL file paths. Used for the dashboard and savings tracking.

- **Path:** `<plugin-data>/data/trends.db`
- **Retention:** Configurable via `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_TRENDS_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: unlimited)
- **Sensitive content:** Contains JSONL file paths which embed the local username as a path component

### Per-Session File Cache (session stores)

SQLite databases with file read records, content hashes, token estimates, and cached file content (up to 50KB per file). **Cached content is credential-redacted before storage** using 22 pattern types (AWS keys, API tokens, etc.).

- **Path:** `<plugin-data>/data/session-store/<session-id>.db`
- **Retention:** Auto-deleted after 48 hours
- **Sensitive content:** Cached source code content (credential-redacted). Activity log with tool call summaries.

### Checkpoints

Markdown files containing truncated conversation context for session continuity. Each checkpoint includes up to 300 characters of the last user message and last assistant message, extracted file paths, decision text, error snippets (up to 150 characters), and todo items.

- **Path:** `~/.claude/token-optimizer/checkpoints/`
- **Retention:** Configurable via `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: 7 days) and `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_CHECKPOINT_RETENTION_MAX` (default: 50 files)
- **Sensitive content:** Truncated conversation snippets may contain PII or sensitive information the user typed into the coding assistant

### Tool Archives

JSON files containing the full output of large tool calls (over 4KB), used for retrieval during the same session. **Content is credential-redacted before storage.**

- **Path:** `<plugin-data>/data/tool-archive/<session-id>/`
- **Retention:** Configurable via `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_ARCHIVE_RETENTION_HOURS` (default: 24 hours)
- **Sensitive content:** Tool output (credential-redacted) which may include file contents, command output, or API responses

### Quality Cache

JSON files with per-session quality score snapshots (6-signal metric).

- **Path:** `~/.claude/token-optimizer/quality-cache-*.json`
- **Retention:** Configurable via `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_QUALITY_CACHE_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: 7 days)
- **Sensitive content:** None

### Configuration and Auxiliary Files

- **Config:** `~/.claude/token-optimizer/config.json` (feature flags, consent status, timestamps)
- **Checkpoint event log:** `~/.claude/token-optimizer/checkpoint-events.jsonl` (rotated at 1000 entries)
- **Live fill cache:** `~/.claude/token-optimizer/live-fill.json`
- **Dashboard:** `<plugin-data>/data/dashboard.html` (generated visualization)
- **Daemon token:** `<plugin-data>/data/daemon-token` (32-byte random secret, 0600 permissions)
- **Daemon logs:** `<plugin-data>/data/logs/` (stdout/stderr from dashboard server)

## Credential Handling

Token Optimizer scans for 22 credential patterns (AWS keys, API tokens, GitHub PATs, database URIs, JWTs, PEM keys, and more) and replaces them with `[CREDENTIAL REDACTED: <type>]` before writing to the session store and tool archive. This redaction is one-way and permanent in stored content.

**Known tradeoff:** Credential redaction in the read cache means delta reads against files containing credentials will produce non-empty diffs on every re-read (the stored version has the redacted placeholder, the live file has the actual credential). This is a deliberate security-over-efficiency tradeoff.

Bash compression output preserves credential-containing lines verbatim (not redacted) to ensure compressed output returned to the coding assistant doesn't mangle secrets.

## Consent

On first activation, Token Optimizer shows a data notice describing what is stored locally and requires acknowledgment before data collection begins. Hooks exit early (no data collection, no blocking tool calls) until consent is granted.

- Check consent status: `python3 measure.py consent --show`
- Reset consent: `python3 measure.py consent --reset`
- Grant consent: `python3 measure.py consent --grant`

Existing users who already saw the v5 welcome notice are automatically considered consented (backward compatible).

## Transcript Preservation

Token Optimizer sets `cleanupPeriodDays=99999` in the host platform's `settings.json` to preserve session transcripts for trend analysis. This is the host platform's cleanup setting, not Token Optimizer's data.

- Transcripts are the host platform's data (JSONL files), not Token Optimizer's
- Users can override this setting in their `settings.json`
- The `purge` command does NOT delete transcripts (they belong to the host platform)

## Data Deletion

To delete all Token Optimizer data across all platforms:

```
python3 measure.py purge            # dry-run: shows what would be deleted
python3 measure.py purge --confirm  # actually delete
```

Manual deletion: remove the following directories:
- `~/.claude/token-optimizer/`
- `~/.claude/plugins/data/token-optimizer-*/`
- `~/.claude/_backups/token-optimizer/`
- For Codex: `~/.codex/token-optimizer/`
- For OpenCode: `~/.local/share/opencode/token-optimizer/`

## Cross-Platform

The same privacy guarantees apply across all supported platforms (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes). Data paths vary by platform but the architecture is identical: local-only, zero network, credential-redacted storage.

Consent is tracked per-runtime. A user running both Claude Code and Codex must acknowledge consent separately in each runtime.
