# Hook Architecture

This document describes Token Optimizer's hook system for security reviewers and pen testers. It covers what hooks fire, what data they access, what they write, and the security boundaries that constrain them.

## Execution Model

```
Host platform tool call
  -> Hook event (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart, etc.)
    -> python-launcher.sh (shebang resolver)
      -> hooks/run.py (stdlib-only dispatcher)
        -> Consent check (fail-open, inline config read)
          -> Target script (measure.py, read_cache.py, etc.)
            -> Local file write (SQLite / JSON / markdown)
```

**Key properties:**
- `run.py` always exits 0 (never blocks a tool call, even on errors)
- 120-second timeout per hook invocation (child process killed on timeout to prevent SQLite lock starvation)
- Subprocess isolation: each hook script runs as a subprocess, not imported
- `run.py` is ~100 lines of stdlib-only Python (no imports from the skills tree)

## Hook Inventory

| Event | Target Script | Purpose | Data Read | Data Written |
|-------|--------------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **PreToolUse[Read]** | `read_cache.py --quiet` | Detect redundant file reads, serve structure maps | Session store SQLite, target file | Session store (file entry, cached content) |
| **PreToolUse[Bash]** | `bash_hook.py --quiet` | Bash output compression pre-check | None | None |
| **PreToolUse[Agent\|Task]** | `measure.py checkpoint-trigger --milestone pre-fanout` | Checkpoint before sub-agent fan-out | Session transcript | Checkpoint markdown file |
| **PreCompact** (x3) | `measure.py dynamic-compact-instructions` | Generate context-aware compaction instructions | Session transcript, trends.db | Compact instructions (stdout) |
| | `measure.py compact-capture --trigger auto` | Capture checkpoint before compaction | Session transcript | Checkpoint markdown + events JSONL |
| | `read_cache.py --clear` | Clear read cache (context is about to compact) | None | Session store (cleared) |
| **SessionStart** (x4) | `measure.py ensure-health` (async) | Verify hooks, daemon, consent, config | settings.json, config.json | settings.json (cleanupPeriodDays), config.json (consent backfill) |
| | `measure.py quality-cache --force` | Warm quality score cache | Session transcript | quality-cache-*.json |
| | `measure.py compact-restore --compact` | Restore checkpoint after compaction | Checkpoint files | None (stdout injection) |
| | `measure.py compact-restore --new-session-only` | Restore checkpoint on new session | Checkpoint files, config.json | None (stdout injection) |
| **Stop** (x2) | `measure.py compact-capture --trigger stop` | Checkpoint on session stop | Session transcript | Checkpoint markdown + events JSONL |
| | `measure.py session-end-flush --trigger stop --defer` | Deferred session metrics flush | Session transcript, trends.db | trends.db (session metrics) |
| **SessionEnd** | `measure.py session-end-flush` (async, 60s) | Full session flush: metrics + dashboard + checkpoint | Session transcript, trends.db | trends.db, dashboard.html, checkpoint |
| **StopFailure** | `measure.py compact-capture --trigger stop-failure` | Checkpoint on failure | Session transcript | Checkpoint markdown |
| **UserPromptSubmit** (x2) | `measure.py quality-cache --warn` | Quality warning injection | quality-cache-*.json | None (stdout injection) |
| | `measure.py prompt-continuity` | Session continuity hint | Checkpoint files, config.json | None (stdout injection) |
| **PostToolUse[Bash\|Read\|...]** | `archive_result.py --quiet` | Archive tool result for retrieval | Tool output (stdin) | tool-archive JSON (credential-redacted) |
| | `context_intel.py --quiet` | Context intelligence scoring | Tool output (stdin) | Session store (activity log) |
| **PostToolUse[Edit\|Write\|...]** | `read_cache.py --invalidate --quiet` | Invalidate read cache on file writes | None | Session store (entry invalidated) |
| **PostToolUse** (throttled) | `measure.py quality-cache --quiet --throttle-only` | Throttled quality cache update | Session transcript | quality-cache-*.json |
| **PostCompact** | `measure.py quality-cache --force` | Re-warm quality cache after compaction | Session transcript | quality-cache-*.json |
| **CwdChanged** | `read_cache.py --clear` | Clear read cache on directory change | None | Session store (cleared) |

## Security Boundaries

### No Shell Execution

- `run.py` uses `subprocess.Popen(cmd)` with a list of arguments, never `shell=True`
- `bash_hook.py` and `bash_compress.py` reject commands containing shell metacharacters: `;|&$(){}><\n\r\x00`
- Only a whitelist of safe environment variables (`HOME`, `PATH`, `LANG`, `TERM`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `TMPDIR`) can be passed through command rewrites

### Path Traversal Protection

- Session IDs are sanitized to `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` with UUID fallback
- Plugin data directory resolution rejects symlinks and requires all paths to resolve inside the runtime home
- Checkpoint trigger names are sanitized to prevent path injection in filenames

### Consent Gate

The consent check runs in `run.py` before any script is dispatched:

1. Read `config.json` from the env-derived config path (inline, no imports from skills tree)
2. If `enterprise_consent_shown` is True: proceed
3. If absent but `v5_welcome_shown` is True: backfill consent atomically, proceed
4. If neither: exit 0 (skip data collection, don't block the tool call)
5. On any error: exit 0 (fail-open)

### Data Isolation

- Each hook receives input via stdin (the host platform's hook payload)
- Hooks cannot access other hooks' stdin or intercept each other's output
- File writes are scoped to Token Optimizer's own data directories
- No hook reads or writes to the user's project source code (except reading files for the read cache, which is the host platform's Read tool operation being intercepted)

## What Hooks Modify in Host Platform Config

`ensure-health` (SessionStart) writes to the host platform's `settings.json`:

- `cleanupPeriodDays: 99999` (preserves transcripts for trend analysis)
- Daemon-related config (dashboard server plist registration on macOS)

These are the only modifications to host platform configuration. All other writes go to Token Optimizer's own data directories.

## Attack Surface Analysis

**Can hooks exfiltrate data?**
No. Zero network calls in the entire codebase. No HTTP clients, sockets, or DNS lookups imported. The only "network" code is the localhost-bound dashboard server.

**Can hooks execute arbitrary code?**
No. No `eval()`, `exec()`, `importlib.import_module(variable)`, or dynamic code loading from external sources. All subprocess calls use static command lists.

**Can hooks modify user source code?**
No. Hooks only write to Token Optimizer's own data directories. The read cache reads project files but writes are to session store SQLite, not back to the source.

**Can a malicious actor register rogue hooks?**
The host platform's `settings.json` is user-writable. An attacker with local filesystem access could add malicious hook entries. Token Optimizer does not perform integrity verification on hook registrations. This is a documented limitation (see SECURITY.md).

**Can hook output influence the AI assistant?**
Yes, by design. Several hooks inject content into the conversation via stdout (checkpoint restore, quality warnings, compaction instructions). This content is controlled by Token Optimizer's own code, not by external input. The injected content is derived from locally stored data (checkpoints, quality scores) that was written by previous Token Optimizer hook invocations.

## Generating a Security Report

```
python3 measure.py security-report        # human-readable report
python3 measure.py security-report --json  # machine-readable for automated assessment
```

The report covers: installed hooks, their target scripts, data store inventory with file permissions, consent status, retention configuration, and credential scanning coverage.
